| Heuristic                                                    | Violation | Recommendation | Severity |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- | -------------- | -------- |
| 1. Visibility of system status - Always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time. | N/A       | N/A            | 0        |
| 2. Match between system and the real world - Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order. |           |                |          |
| 3. User control and freedom - Users should leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. undo and redo. |           |                |          |
| 4. Consistency and standards - Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. |           |                |          |
| 5. Error prevention - Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action. |           |                |          |
| 6. Recognition rather than recall - Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. |           |                |          |
| 7. Flexibility and efficiency of use - Accelerators. Allow users to tailor frequent actions. |           |                |          |
| 8. Aesthetic and minimalist design - Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. |           |                |          |
| 9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors - Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution. |           |                |          |
| 10. Help and documentation - Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. |           |                |          |
