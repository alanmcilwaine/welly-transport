| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| 1. Visibility of system status - Always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time.                                                             | - It's not clear how to tell where the user is when on the alerts page, and UI design may make it difficult for a user to tell what they're interacting with in other pages.                                                 | - Use both labels and icons to help make navigation clearer, and use more obvious contexts to show where the user is navigating.                                                                            | 2        |
| 2. Match between system and the real world - Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.                                                                | - UI is difficult to navigate, as it does not account for F or Z scanning heuristics, giving difficulty in navigating.<br>- Lots of the UI design does not accommodate for touch hierarchy, adding difficulty in navigating. | - Reorganize UI to accommodate for F and Z pattern reading behaviour.<br>- Reorganize UI to accommodate for touch hierarchy.                                                                                | 4        |
| 3. User control and freedom - Users should leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. undo and redo.                                                                | - Lack of return or back button in the app<br>- Does not follow any touch heiarchy.                                                                                                                                          | - A clear input button to reset the page would be a nice addition, allowing for users to quickly change.<br>- Reorganise UI to make user control flow better.                                               | 2        |
| 4. Consistency and standards - Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing.                                                                  | - Bottom navigation buttons are not consistent, Plan, Map, and Times menu use labels, however alerts and search use icons.                                                                                                   | - Consider choosing either icon or label for navigation menu, or even a combination of both icon and label on the navigation menus.                                                                         | 3        |
| 5. Error prevention - Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action.                                       | N/A                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Feedback: I like how in your timetables tab, all the problematic lines have a warning symbol to show that there are alerts related to said service, and the "search doesn't exist" display also looks good. | 0        |
| 6. Recognition rather than recall - Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible.                                                                                 | - Button navigation buttons are not consistent, Plan, Map, and Times menu use labels, however alerts and search use icons.                                                                                                   | - Switching from icons and labels for the navigation buttons makes navigation memorisation more difficult to do, because of the lack of consistency.                                                        | 2        |
| 7. Flexibility and efficiency of use - Accelerators. Allow users to tailor frequent actions.                                                                                                         | - No clear way for user to add their own saved trips.                                                                                                                                                                        | - The inclusion of "Saved Trips" in the app is a great touch, however, there's no evident way to add your own saved trips                                                                                   | 1        |
| 8. Aesthetic and minimalist design - Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed.                                                                                  | - Only necessary information is displayed, but are organized too densely and thus makes interaction.                                                                                                                         | - Reorganize and add more space between UI elements to lessen navigation confusion, and improve aesthetics.                                                                                                 | 3        |
| 9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors - Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution. | - Only one error is shown, being "search doesnt exist error.                                                                                                                                                                 | - Consider implementing other errors.                                                                                                                                                                       | 1        |
| 10. Help and documentation - Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation.                                        | N/A                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | - Userflows help a lot with documentation, however consider adding additional user flows for all UI elements.                                                                                               | 1        |
