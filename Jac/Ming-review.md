| Heuristic                                                    | Violation                                                    | Recommendation                                               | Severity |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| 1. Visibility of system status - Always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time. | N/A                                                          | N/A                                                          | 0        |
| 2. Match between system and the real world - Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order. | N/A                                                          | N/A                                                          | 0        |
| 3. User control and freedom - Users should leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. undo and redo. | Search bar and navigation bar allows for user control and freedom but no examples of buttons that allow user to move back by a sub-page. | If sub-pages are implemented, add in back buttons that preserve data like services in search. | 2        |
| 4. Consistency and standards - Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. | Services page is confusing. Expected a list of services and I'm not sure what this is supposed to be. | Clean up the services page and make clear what's supposed to be there. | 3        |
| 5. Error prevention - Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action. | No examples of error prevention is shown.                    | Show examples of error prevention, for example, when  searching for services that doesn't exist | 2        |
| 6. Recognition rather than recall - Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. | N/A                                                          | N/A                                                          | 0        |
| 7. Flexibility and efficiency of use - Accelerators. Allow users to tailor frequent actions. | N/A                                                          | N/A                                                          | 0        |
| 8. Aesthetic and minimalist design - Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. | N/A                                                          | N/A                                                          | 0        |
| 9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors - Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution. | Not implemented                                              | N/A                                                          | 1        |
| 10. Help and documentation - Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. | N/A                                                          | Could add in documentation?                                  | 1        |
