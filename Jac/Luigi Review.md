| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| 1. Visibility of system status - Always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time.                                                             | - Can be somewhat difficult for a user to tell whether they are on the services tab or the stops tab                                                                                                                       | - Consider adjusting size and colour of menu subtitle to make it clearer to the user to what menu they are currently on.                                                                                                                                                                                 | 1        |
| 2. Match between system and the real world - Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.                                                                | - It is not shown if these information displays can show more detail if the user requests for it.<br>- User might not be able to tell what kind of vehicle they are using, Is the info displayed for a train or for a bus? | - An additional wireframe showing an information display of services or stops with more detail about the route or vehicle would be great<br>- Consider using more colour to your design, you make good use of contrast with the use of black buttons in some areas, but more colour will make it better. | 2        |
| 3. User control and freedom - Users should leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. undo and redo.                                                                | - Lack of back button to return to previous panel.                                                                                                                                                                         | - Adding a back button somewhere in the UI will significantly boost User Experience, consider ergonomic placement for even better.                                                                                                                                                                       | 2        |
| 4. Consistency and standards - Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing.                                                                  | N/A                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | - Consider relocating search bar to the bottom, just above your home row, to allow for better touch hierarchy.<br>Feedback: UI is incredibly consistent, from button placements, to visual design, to search boxes                                                                                       | 1        |
| 5. Error prevention - Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action.                                       | - No errors prevention displayed on wireframes                                                                                                                                                                             | - Consider implementing user error prevention techniques, an example being "are you sure you want to clear?" prompt. This example may not apply very well in your wireframes, just an example.                                                                                                           | 2        |
| 6. Recognition rather than recall - Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible.                                                                                 | - No icons are shown on stops                                                                                                                                                                                              | - Consider implementing icons beside the information display subtitles, and service/stop information, doing this can also solve Heuristic 2 problems                                                                                                                                                     | 2        |
| 7. Flexibility and efficiency of use - Accelerators. Allow users to tailor frequent actions.                                                                                                         | - No clear way for user to add their own saved trips.                                                                                                                                                                      | - Recently searched results are displayed on the search menus, which are a great touch, implementing common route saving will take this one step further.                                                                                                                                                | 2        |
| 8. Aesthetic and minimalist design - Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed.                                                                                  | N/A                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Feedback: UI design is very simple and minimalist.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 0        |
| 9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors - Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution. | - No error screen shown.                                                                                                                                                                                                   | - Demonstrating how an error would pop up to a user can help a user understand what went wrong and possibly self diagnose an issue.                                                                                                                                                                      | 2        |
| 10. Help and documentation - Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation.                                        | - No documentation provided with wireframes.                                                                                                                                                                               | - Documentation such as user flows, or a dedicated help page may enhance user experiencing by teaching a user how to navigate and use the app.                                                                                                                                                           | 2        |
