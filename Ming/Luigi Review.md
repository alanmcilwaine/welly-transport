# Heuristic Evaluation

Evaluator Name: Luigi

## Top Recommendations

- Make UI more consistent
- Consider adding more aesthetic elements to pretty up the UI
- More use of icons to give a user more visual feedback and better context

### Severity Rating

0 = I don't agree that this is a usability problem at all

1 = Cosmetic problem only: fix if time is available

2 = Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority

3 = Major usability problem: important to fix, given high priority

4 = Usability catastrophe: fix this before product can be released

| 1. Visibility of system status - Always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time.                                                             | - Can be somewhat difficult for a user to tell whether they are on the services tab or the stops tab                                                                                                                                                                                     | - Consider adding a subtitle or header at the top of the pages to give the user better understanding where they are in the app.<br>- Consider using both labels and icons to help make navigation around the app clearer                                                                           | 2        |
| 2. Match between system and the real world - Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.                                                                | - It is not shown if these information displays can show more detail if the user requests for it.<br>- User might not be able to tell what kind of vehicle they are using, Is the info displayed for a train or for a bus?<br>- No wireframe display about specific location information | - An additional wireframe showing an information display of services or stops with more detail about the route or vehicle would be great.<br>- Using more icons on the information displays to inform the user what kind of information is being displayed, such as bus icon for bus services etc. | 2        |
| 3. User control and freedom - Users should leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. undo and redo.                                                                | N/A                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | - Consider aligning the back button to be more inline with other UI elements, or even relocating for touch hierarchy considerations.<br>- A clear input button to reset the page would be a nice addition, allowing for users to quickly change.                                                   | 1        |
| 4. Consistency and standards - Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing.                                                                  | - Each menu/page/tab have very different looks from one another, making the design inconsistent. Some elements have boarders and white space around them, other elements take up the entire width of the screen                                                                          | - Create a general design language to make each page more consistent with each other, current design will confuse first time users and elderly.                                                                                                                                                    | 3        |
| 5. Error prevention - Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action.                                       | - No errors prevention displayed on wireframes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | - Consider implementing user error prevention techniques, an example being "are you sure you want to clear?" prompt. This example may not apply very well in your wireframes, just an example.                                                                                                     | 2        |
| 6. Recognition rather than recall - Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible.                                                                                 | - No icons or labels are shown to differentiate between different types of services in the search menu, this will be confusing for first time users, those unfamiliar with services, and elderly                                                                                         | - Implement visual feedback to give users some context with what services they are using.                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 3        |
| 7. Flexibility and efficiency of use - Accelerators. Allow users to tailor frequent actions.                                                                                                         | N/A                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Feedback: Very simple way to save common or desired services, and are immediately displayed on the search menu.                                                                                                                                                                                    | 0        |
| 8. Aesthetic and minimalist design - Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed.                                                                                  | - Lack of icons in information display menus<br>- No effort is shown to "pretty up" the UI, making the UI look dated                                                                                                                                                                     | - Add icons to information displays<br>- Make UI elements more consistent, considering placement and colour                                                                                                                                                                                        | 3        |
| 9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors - Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution. | - No error screen shown.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | - Demonstrating how an error would pop up to a user can help a user understand what went wrong and possibly self diagnose an issue.                                                                                                                                                                | 1        |
| 10. Help and documentation - Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation.                                        | N/A                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Feedback: Userflows help a lot with documentation for navigating the UI                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 0        |
