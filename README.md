# Background to the project
We wanted our project to be an app that helped a diverse array of commuters. When we brainstormed together, we saw many existing apps like Google Maps was very one-size-fits-all where accessibility options were hidden away under menus. Additionally, a common heuristic fault we found during the review was lock of freedom (undo, customisability). Therefore our goals were:
1. Add customisability to our app for each user.
2. Minimise the amount of taps to get required information.
3. Being able to undo from all screens.

To address this, we designed a customisable home page where users can add many widgets to adjust the apps to their needs. We designed the top bar to always contain an undo button. 

# Personas
We used the Alex persona during the development of this app. Additionally, we created a new persona based on Sergio's assignment 2 persona which had a disabled/elderly end user.

# Design Ideation
The wireframes and user flows from assignment 2 for each member of the project are visible in HeuristicReviews/(user)/

# Design Reviews
Each person had three evaluatee's. We did a heuristic evaluation following Jakob Nielsen's 10 usability heuristics. These are visible in HeuristicReviews/(user)/(name)-Review.md.
