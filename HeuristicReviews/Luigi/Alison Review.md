# Heuristic Evaluation

## Top Recommendations

- Add a more traditional navigation bar, either along the top of the screen, or at the bottom to replace the quick menu (which could then be swapped back in as an accessibility setting, as it could be preferred by some users).
- Include only top-level information on alerts (eg. severity, services affected), further information accessible by selecting that alert. Similar fix for route planning options, settings groups, etc.
- Add help page to top bar, alongside profile and settings. This is a position where new users will look for it first.

###  Severity Rating 

0 = I don't agree that this is a usability problem at all 

1 = Cosmetic problem only: fix if time is available 

2 = Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority 

3 = Major usability problem: important to fix, given high priority 

4 = Usability catastrophe: fix this before product can be released 


| Heuristic | Violation | Recommendation | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Visibility of system status - Always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time. | All information on the current state of the app is communicated effectively. | - | 0 |
| 2. Match between system and the real world - Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order. | The interface is unconventional; while it can be used efficiently once learned, it is missing familiar navigation options for new users. The "quick menu" should not be the only method of navigation through the app. | Add a more traditional navigation bar, either along the top of the screen, or at the bottom to replace the quick menu (which could then be swapped back in as an accessibility setting, as it could be preferred by some users). | 4 |
| 3. User control and freedom - Users should leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. undo and redo. | It is easy to leave an unwanted state, or to change an unwanted input. | - | 0 |
| 4. Consistency and standards - Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. | Icons for the three main pages are used consistently. Search bar and back button are in the same place on each page that includes one. While unconventional, the interface is very consistent. | - | 0 |
| 5. Error prevention - Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action. | Many options are small and close together, making accidental input mistakes easy to make and difficult to spot. | Space out and enlarge some interactive elements. If this makes the interface too large and unwieldy, move them to submenus instead. | 1 |
| 6. Recognition rather than recall - Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. | The app is designed with this in mind, all relevant options are visible and recognisable on any given screen. | - | 0 |
| 7. Flexibility and efficiency of use - Accelerators. Allow users to tailor frequent actions. | Saved addresses are a useful feature, but need to be more discoverable within the interface. | Make it possible to save an address from within the interface, and show saved addresses as navigation options on the home screen. | 2 |
| 8. Aesthetic and minimalist design - Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. | There is a lot of information presented to the user, particularly on the route planning and alert screens. Seeing all detail on all available options and all alerts makes it more difficult to find wanted information. | Include only top-level information on alerts (eg. severity, services affected), further information accessible by selecting that alert. Similar fix for route planning options, settings groups, etc. | 3 |
| 9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors - Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution. | The amount of information on the interface may make errors less visible (for example, entering an incorrect destination or transport mode). | Make the entered start and end points, and selected transport modes, more visible (by making them more visibly highlighted, or represented by name/icon on the map). | 1 |
| 10. Help and documentation - Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. | No help option, which may be very useful for this more novel interface. | Add help page to top bar, alongside profile and settings. This is a position where new users will look for it first. | 3 |
