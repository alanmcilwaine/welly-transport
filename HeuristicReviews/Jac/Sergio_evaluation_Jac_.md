# Heuristic Evaluation  
**Evaluator Name:** Sergio 

## Top Recommendations  
1. **Clarify distances** - The "999km away" display might confuse users. A simple fix could make this clearer.  
2. **Consistent labeling** - Aligning terms like "Favourite" and "Recently searched" would create a smoother experience.  
3. **Add undo options** - Letting users easily undo actions would make the app feel more forgiving and user-friendly.

| Heuristic                                                   | Observation                                                                 | Suggestion                                                                 | Severity |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| **1. Visibility of system status**                          | Service delays are noted, but could be more visible.                        | Consider making delay alerts more prominent with icons or colors.          | 2        |
| **2. Match between system and real world**                  | "999km away" seems unrealistic for a station distance.                      | Could show "Not nearby" or allow hiding distant stations.                  | 2        |
| **3. User control and freedom**                             | No way to undo if someone accidentally saves a favorite.                    | A simple "Undo" option after saving would help.                            | 2        |
| **4. Consistency and standards**                            | Different sections use slightly different terms ("Favourite" vs "Recent").  | Using the same wording throughout would feel more polished.                | 1        |
| **5. Error prevention**                                     | Users might accidentally save wrong favorites.                              | A quick "Added to favorites!" confirmation could prevent mistakes.         | 1        |
| **6. Recognition rather than recall**                       | Need to tap "Read" to see full delay details.                               | Showing a bit more info upfront would be helpful.                          | 2        |
| **7. Flexibility and efficiency**                           | No shortcuts for frequent actions like reordering favorites.                | Allowing custom sorting would help frequent users.                         | 1        |
| **8. Aesthetic and minimalist design**                      | Some distances shown may not be useful (like 999km).                        | Hiding extreme distances would clean up the interface.                     | 1        |
| **9. Help users recover from errors**                       | If a search fails, there's no guidance.                                     | Adding "No results? Try..." suggestions would be welcoming.                | 2        |
| **10. Help and documentation**                              | Some features like Quick Links aren't explained.                            | Small tooltips or a quick tutorial would help new users.                   | 1        |
