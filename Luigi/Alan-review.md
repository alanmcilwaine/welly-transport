# Heuristic Evaluation 
Evaluator Name: Alan

## Top Recommendations

- Some screens contain lots of information. I (subjectively) recommend putting sections of these screens into a drilldown screen.
- Implement a home button.

###  Severity Rating 

0 = I don't agree that this is a usability problem at all 

1 = Cosmetic problem only: fix if time is available 

2 = Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority 

3 = Major usability problem: important to fix, given high priority 

4 = Usability catastrophe: fix this before product can be released

| 1. Visibility of system status - Always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time.                                                      | I don't see any violation of 1. At the top of each wireframe is an indication of the page the user is on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | N/A                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 0        |
| 2. Match between system and the real world - Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.                                                         | I don't see any violation of 2. Good language is used and common symbols on real world Metlink timetables are used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | N/A                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 0        |
| 3. User control and freedom - Users should leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. undo and redo.                                                         | For more user control, it would be nice to have a reset/home button.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Have a way to go to the default home menu from any page. This could be in the top right alongside settings and profile.                                                                                                                                                                                                        | 2        |
| 4. Consistency and standards - Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing.                                                           | I find it ambiguous whether the bottom right back button undo's the last action or fully resets/goes home.<br><br>Element sizing and organisation looks inconsistent. For example, (1) the bottom right button changes size when in settings/profile. (2) "Plan route menu" and "Timetable" show transport options differently, one as icons and the other as text. | A home button as stated in 3 to remove any ambiguity.<br><br>Change sizing in profile/options to match the other screens.<br><br>Consistently use icons for transport services. <br><br>These are all quite nit-picky and don't fundamentally change the UX, so 2 severity.                                                    | 2        |
| 5. Error prevention - Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action.                                | It's hard to tell with sizing but it looks like the checkboxes and buttons in settings are quite close together and I commonly accidentally press the wrong button when they're close together.                                                                                                                                                                     | Increase the spacing between buttons, if this causes elements to not fit then potentially add a smaller seperate page like "Push notifications".                                                                                                                                                                               | 1        |
| 6. Recognition rather than recall - Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible.                                                                          | I don't see any violation of 6. I like that the search displays a list of train lines so the user doesn't have to recall it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | N/A                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 0        |
| 7. Flexibility and efficiency of use - Accelerators. Allow users to tailor frequent actions.                                                                                                  | I think the quick menu should be explored more as an efficiency concept.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | It would be cool to pin any page to the quick menu. <br><br>Also, I think being able to access the quick menu from any page would be a huge accelerator. I could imagine this by holding the button in the bottom right to access the quick menu. It could get messy though.                                                   | 1        |
| 8. Aesthetic and minimalist design - Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed.                                                                           | Some screens contain a large amount of information/text, for example the plan route menu, profile, and settings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | The profile and settings, maybe create submenu's that link to a smaller seperate page like apps such as Reddit do with their settings.<br><br>The plan route menu being busy is subjective. I prefer it being simpler so I would remove the "From" and "To" from the map and instead highlight the selected route in the menu. | 3        |
| 9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors - Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a so | This isn't really a violation, just missing from the wireframes. I would like to see what happens when users input a wrong station, or no routes are found.                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Include an error message such as "No routes found for selected route". And "No results found for..."                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 1        |
| 10. Help and documentation - Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation.                                 | This is also missing from the wireframes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | A helpful form of documentation could be a directory of train lines, stops and stations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 1        |
