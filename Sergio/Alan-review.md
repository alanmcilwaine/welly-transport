# Heuristic Evaluation 
Evaluator Name: Alan

## Top Recommendations

- Implement an undo button after moving to a seperate page.
- Include a header or way to signify the page the user is on. For example, if the user went "Home -> Plan a Trip" this could be displayed in the header.

###  Severity Rating

| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| 1. Visibility of system status - Always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time.                                                             | It's unclear I'm on the Trip Planner screen without reading context clues from the page.<br><br>                                                                                                                                              | Have a header for the name of the screen at the top. For example, the "Trip Planner" section has "Plan a Trip" at the top.                                                        | 2        |
| 2. Match between system and the real world - Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.                                                                | I don't see any violation of 2. Plain language is used, information appears top down with planning in the middle.                                                                                                                             | N/A                                                                                                                                                                               | 0        |
| 3. User control and freedom - Users should leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. undo and redo.                                                                | Implemented well: It looks like you can re-press buttons in the bottom menu to go to their landing page.<br><br>Violation: There is no clear way to revert backwards.                                                                         | 1. Have an undo button in the interface, for consistency this could be in the top left.<br><br>2. Additionally, have a redo button appearing in the top right to redo a decision. | 3        |
| 4. Consistency and standards - Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing.                                                                  | I don't see any violation of 2. Having the (+,-) in the top right was confusing instead of being in Settings, but I think that's fine because you can see the zoom on the page.                                                               | N/A                                                                                                                                                                               | 0        |
| 5. Error prevention - Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action.                                       | Checkboxes in the settings at the bottom look very close together and easy to press the wrong one.                                                                                                                                            | Asking the user for confirmation when pressing log out.<br><br>Increasing height between checkboxes to avoid accidentally pressing the wrong one.                                 | 2        |
| 6. Recognition rather than recall - Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible.                                                                                 | I think this is implemented well by letting the user enter their destination from the small map screen (recognition) and having a saved trips section. Additionally, the trip-planner has an auto-detect location acting as recognition help. | N/A                                                                                                                                                                               | 0        |
| 7. Flexibility and efficiency of use - Accelerators. Allow users to tailor frequent actions.                                                                                                         | I don't see any violation of 7. The user can save trips, as well as save common destinations which is great for experienced users.                                                                                                            | N/A                                                                                                                                                                               | 0        |
| 8. Aesthetic and minimalist design - Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed.                                                                                  | This is preference but there is a lot of accessibility tools that might be rarely needed by many users.                                                                                                                                       | Show accessibility tools by default, then have an option in settings to remove them. e.g Ability to remove Audio Guidance, Step Free and Priority Seating in settings.            | 1        |
| 9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors - Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution. | As a violation, it is not shown what happens when inputting a non-existent location.                                                                                                                                                          | Display a warning of some kind saying "No results found".                                                                                                                         | 1        |
| 10. Help and documentation - Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation.                                        | The tourist page looks like it has documentation about tourist attractions. <br><br>As a violation, it would be nice to have an explanation somewhere of what the accessibility features do.                                                  | It would be nice in settings to have an explanation of the various accessibility features and what they do.                                                                       | 1        |
