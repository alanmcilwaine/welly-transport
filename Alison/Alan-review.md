# Heuristic Evaluation 
Evaluator Name: Alan

## Top Recommendations

- Implement a visible undo button to revert to an older state.
- Have some way to pick a line or station without having to remember their names. This could be done through a map or directory of some kind.

###  Severity Rating 

0 = I don't agree that this is a usability problem at all 

1 = Cosmetic problem only: fix if time is available 

2 = Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority 

3 = Major usability problem: important to fix, given high priority 

4 = Usability catastrophe: fix this before product can be released

| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| 1. Visibility of system status - Always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time.                                                             | I don't see any violation of 1. At the top of each wireframe is an indication of the page the user is on.                                                                                                                                      | N/A                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 0        |
| 2. Match between system and the real world - Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.                                                                | I don't see any violation of 2. Plain language is used and common symbols on real world Metlink timetables are used.                                                                                                                           | N/A                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 0        |
| 3. User control and freedom - Users should leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. undo and redo.                                                                | There is no clear navigation buttons in the user flows to undo/redo. No clear way to go Home.                                                                                                                                                  | 1. An undo button appears when moving to a new page.<br>2. A redo button appears when pressing the undo button. (Not as important).<br>3. A home button to go back to the start (Maybe this is already in the hamburger menu.)  | 3        |
| 4. Consistency and standards - Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing.                                                                  | This is minor but I didn't understand the  "Line/Stop Information" button until it was opened up.                                                                                                                                              | I would recommend using the information icon ('i' in a circle) to signify details, instead of the train and car symbol.                                                                                                         | 1        |
| 5. Error prevention - Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action.                                       | Not implemented in wireframes however this isn't a high risk field so no need for it in my opinion.                                                                                                                                            | An undo button as stated in 3. would prevent errors from becoming permanent.                                                                                                                                                    | 1        |
| 6. Recognition rather than recall - Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible.                                                                                 | I think this is implemented very well, both the "recently viewed" and navigation icon act as a form of recognition. <br><br>As a violation, the user is forced to recall a station name if it's too far away for the navigation icon to reach. | I would recommend providing a directory of lines and stations. This way names are recognised from a list instead of recalled.                                                                                                   | 1        |
| 7. Flexibility and efficiency of use - Accelerators. Allow users to tailor frequent actions.                                                                                                         | I don't see any violation of 7. Expert users can favourite their trips, and inexperienced users have the "recently viewed".                                                                                                                    | N/A                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 0        |
| 8. Aesthetic and minimalist design - Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed.                                                                                  | For first time users, the recently viewed and favourites contain irrelevant information because these sections won't be filled yet.                                                                                                            | I would recommend minimising the footprint of recently viewed and/or favourites on the Home screen if they're empty. This is debatable though because they already aren't taking up much space.                                 | 1        |
| 9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors - Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution. | As a violation, I would like to see what happens when users input a wrong station, or there are no Upcoming Departures. This is not shown in wireframes.                                                                                       | I would recommend adding text to the search when no station is found "No results found for ----".                                                                                                                               | 1        |
| 10. Help and documentation - Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation.                                        | Not implemented in the wireframes.                                                                                                                                                                                                             | I would recommend adding extra text to the search when no lines and stations is found, this text would link to a directory of stops and stations. For example "No results found for ----, **View list of lines and stations.**" | 3        |
|                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |          |
