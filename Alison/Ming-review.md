# Heuristic Evaluation 
Evaluator Name: Ming

## Top Recommendations

- Streamline the process so that it takes no searches and less than 2 taps to get to relevant information.
- add back button for sub pages and make the buttons to go to other pages visible at all times.

###  Severity Rating 

0 = I don't agree that this is a usability problem at all 

1 = Cosmetic problem only: fix if time is available 

2 = Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority 

3 = Major usability problem: important to fix, given high priority 

4 = Usability catastrophe: fix this before product can be released 


| Heuristic                                                    | Violation                                                    | Recommendation                                               | Severity |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| 1. Visibility of system status - Always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time. | In the user flows part, all of the pages are labeled home when it makes more sense for it to be labeled with things like view train line like the wireframes | update page name as the user navigates pages.                | 2        |
| 2. Match between system and the real world - Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order. | N/A                                                          | N/A                                                          | 0        |
| 3. User control and freedom - Users should leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. undo and redo. | No back button and looks like back to main page requires an extra tap in the three lines on the top left. | add back button for sub pages and make the buttons to go to other pages visible at all times. | 3        |
| 4. Consistency and standards - Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. | N/A                                                          | N/A                                                          | 0        |
| 5. Error prevention - Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action. | Not implemented                                              | N/A                                                          | 0        |
| 6. Recognition rather than recall - Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. | N/A                                                          | N/A                                                          | 0        |
| 7. Flexibility and efficiency of use - Accelerators. Allow users to tailor frequent actions. | The amount of taps and searched that a user takes to get to actual information is too many. | Streamline the process so that it takes no searches and less than 2 taps to get to relevant information. | 3        |
| 8. Aesthetic and minimalist design - Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. | Stations contain things like amenities which is not relevant to planning trips. | Remove unnecessary information from station info.            | 2        |
| 9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors - Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution. | Not implemented                                              | N/A                                                          | 1        |
| 10. Help and documentation - Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. | Not implemented                                              | N/A                                                          | 1        |
