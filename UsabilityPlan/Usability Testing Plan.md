# Testing Overview:
The following document describes the plan for usability testing of the prototype of the Team 12 Transport App.

These are the objectives of usability testing:
* Determine a first-time user performance and satisfaction with the application; allowing
comparison to be done on later usability testing.
* Identify potential errors in the application and design concerns to be altered in later
versions.
* Determine user satisfaction with the application.

These objectives will be completed through analysis of data from test participants, including participant feedback and interaction with the system. Specific metrics have been set out in this test plan to standardise data obtained for test participants. 

The intended user base of Team 12's Transport App are daily commuters in the Wellington region. Participants in testing consist of 4 groups of 6 students (expected) studying SWEN303 at Victoria University of Wellington.

# Methodology:
6-12 participants will be test users, who will carry out testing in-person in computer labs CO238 and CO234. Testing will be carried out on a Figma prototype version of the application.

## Participants
Participants will be selected from other groups from Group C, working on similar applications. For this reason, they will be more familiar than the average first time user with the software engineering involved in creating this kind of system. As a result, we expect them to be more proficient at the tasks we present them with than the average user would be. This bias should be taken into account when reviewing the results of our tests.

## Training


## Procedure
Testing will take place at a specific ECS machine, ideally in a designated quiet corner of one of the labs. The Facilitator will prepare the Figma prototype in a browser window on this machine, ensuring that it is on the application's home page and is the only thing on screen.

The Facilitator will then guide the test participant to the designated machine, where the Note Taker will also be positioned. The Facilitator will 

# The Script
## Intro
Welcome to the usability testing of Team 12's transport app. In this session, we will be recording your interactions and feedback while testing the prototype, do you provide consent?

The purpose of our app is to organise and plan a transport route for a diverse array of commuters. Users will be able to plan a route between two stops and select their preferred route. These can be saved, and viewed under widgets on the home screen. Alongside route planning, users can: 
* Customise their home screen with an array of widgets,
* View train and bus alerts in the Wellington region,
* View timetables of specific stops or services,
* And seek help through the settings.
The main goals of our app is to:
* Improve customisability for each user,
* Minimise the amount of taps to get required information,
* And undo from multiple states.
## Your Tasks
In order to make the testing process as simple as possible, we'll get you to perform a short set of tasks on our Figma prototype. At the end of each task, please note any difficulties you had with the task. When you've finished the task set, please fill out the Google form. We’ve tried to make the form as concise as possible, so that it won’t take too long. That being said, we’d really appreciate as much detail in the feedback as you’re comfortable giving us. We have included 3 tasks with instructions and 3 without instructions. We’ve done this to simulate the contrast in experience between that of an ideal user flow (with instructions) compared to that of a new user (without instructions). Please comment on any differences between the two.

**The tester will then proceed to ask the user to complete the tasks detailed below:**

# Roles
