# Testing Overview:
The following document describes the plan for usability testing of the prototype of the Team 12 Transport App.

These are the objectives of usability testing:
* Determine a first-time user performance and satisfaction with the application; allowing
comparison to be done on later usability testing.
* Identify potential errors in the application and design concerns to be altered in later
versions.
* Determine user satisfaction with the application.

These objectives will be completed through analysis of data from test participants, including participant feedback and interaction with the system. Specific metrics have been set out in this test plan to standardise data obtained for test participants. 

The intended user base of Team 12's Transport App are daily commuters in the Wellington region. Participants in testing consist of 4 groups of 6 students (expected) studying SWEN303 at Victoria University of Wellington.

# Methodology:
A minimum of 12 participants and a maximum of 24 will be acting as test users in usability testing which will be carried out in-person in lab rooms CO238 and CO242. Users will carry out testing with a prototype version of the app created in Figma.

# The Script
## Intro
Welcome to the usability testing of Team 12's transport app. In this session, we will be recording your interactions and feedback while testing the prototype, do you provide consent?

The purpose of our app is to organise and plan a transport route for a diverse array of commuters. Users will be able to plan a route between two stops and select their preferred route. These can be saved, and viewed under widgets on the home screen. Alongside route planning, users can: 
* Customise their home screen with an array of widgets,
* View train and bus alerts in the Wellington region,
* View timetables of specific stops or services,
* And seek help through the settings.
The main goals of our app is to:
* Improve customisability for each user,
* Minimise the amount of taps to get required information,
* And undo from multiple states.
## Your Tasks
In order to make the testing process as simple as possible, we'll get you to perform a short set of tasks on our Figma prototype. At the end of each task, please note any difficulties you had with the task. When you've finished the task set, please fill out the Google form. We’ve tried to make the form as concise as possible, so that it won’t take too long. That being said, we’d really appreciate as much detail in the feedback as you’re comfortable giving us. We have included 3 tasks with instructions and 3 without instructions. We’ve done this to simulate the contrast in experience between that of an ideal user flow (with instructions) compared to that of a new user (without instructions). Please comment on any differences between the two.

**The tester will then proceed to ask the user to complete the tasks detailed below:**

# Roles

## Facilitator
* Contacts the test group
* Schedules times and locations for testing
* Provides additional information on request
## Note Taker
* Records notes from the test subjects
* Records any interaction between the testing organisers and the test subjects.
## Analyst
* Performs analysis on the data after testing has been completed
* Helps suggest improvements based on trends in subject answers
## Test Subject
* Completes the tasks given by the Facilitator
* Inputs answers to the questions asked
* Submits a form

# Tasks

# Metrics

# Usability Goals

The mobile app should achieve an average System Usability Scale (SUS) score of at least 68, indicating acceptable usability, with an optimal target of 75 or higher to reflect good to excellent usability [source](https://measuringu.com/sus/). This score should be measured through usability testing with representative users performing key travel-related tasks, such as planning a route, checking arrival times, and navigating through the app.
