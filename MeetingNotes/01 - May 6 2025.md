# Assigned Roles and tasks
Schedules and assigned work to be seen in the GitLab ReadMe
# App Design
Important considerations to keep in mind when we design our app
- App ergonomics
- Sufficient and minimalistic information displays
- Home page being quick to load, such as showing quick navigations or alerts
- Colour and contrast to make it more appealing to the eye
	- Take in consideration visual difficulties such as colour blindness
